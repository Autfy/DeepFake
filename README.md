# DeepFake
A spare-time research project I started for my interest, challenge and experience, aiming to create DeepFake videos - copying a person's face/body gestures and voice from one video to another video (of another person). 

## Project Roadmap
**(last update: 2019/06/10)**

1. (100%) developing a script to extract frames from a video.

2. (100%) developing a simple auto-encoder for images.

3. (0%) developing a visual DeepFake with crossed auto-encoders sharing the same encoder.

4. (0%) developing a GAN-based auto-encoder for images.

5. (0%) developing a visual DeepFake with crossed GAN-based auto-encoders.

6. (0%) developing a script to extract voice from a video.

7. (0%) developing a simple auto-encoder for voice.

8. (0%) developing a voice DeepFake with crossed auto-encoders sharing the same encoder.

9. (0%) combining everything, creating a complete DeepFake video.
